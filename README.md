This project focuses on exploring what the acceptance rate is for drives who 
recieve two different coupon types - bar coupons and coffee house coupons - based
on different characteristics.


**Takeaways from the bar coupon scenario:**

- Most notable: Drivers who go to bars at least once a month have an acceptance rate of 71.3%
- Other indicators: Drivers who don't have kids and make a decent living are more likely to accept a bar coupon.


**Takeaways from the coffee house coupon scenario:**

When combining six of the characteristics together of drivers receiving coupons to a 
**Coffee House**, it's quite intriguing to see how high the acceptance rate becomes. 
Let’s make drivers who already have a habit of going to coffee houses be the 
baseline, then layer on top of that additional characteristics to see how the 
acceptance rate evolves: 

- Passengers who go to coffee houses at least once a month have an acceptance rate of: 66.0%
- Additionally, if they are in no rush to get to a final destination, the acceptance rate grows to: 73.9%
- If they are also driving with at least one friend, the acceptance rate grows to: 76.3%
- Furthermore, if it’s late morning or early afternoon, the acceptance rate grows to: 78.6%
- If the expiration date is one day, the acceptance rate grows to: 83.1%
- Finally, if the driver is either unemployed or a student, the acceptance rate grows further to: 92.7%

**Conclusion for the coffee house scenario**

When combining six of the characteristics together of drivers receiving coupons to a **Coffee House**, it's quite intriguing to see how high the acceptance rate becomes. Let’s make drivers who already have a habit of going to coffee houses be the baseline, then layer on top of that additional characteristics to see how the acceptance rate evolves: 

- Passengers who go to coffee houses at least once a month have an acceptance rate of: 66.0%
- Additionally, if they are in no rush to get to a final destination, the acceptance rate grows to: 73.9%
- If they are also driving with at least one friend, the acceptance rate grows to: 76.3%
- Furthermore, if it’s late morning or early afternoon, the acceptance rate grows to: 78.6%
- If the expiration date is one day, the acceptance rate grows to: 83.1%
- Finally, if the driver is either unemployed or a student, the acceptance rate grows further to: 92.7%

Based on these findings, **my recommendation** is to target drivers that already have a habit of going to coffee houses. Depending on budget, the targeted drivers can be refined by adding one or more of the six characteristincs (destination, passanger, time, expiration, occupation) specified above to the filtering criteria.
